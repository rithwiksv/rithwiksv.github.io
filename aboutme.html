    Hi! I am Rithwik. I will be starting my
    graduate school at MSU in Fall 2021. I did my undergraduate at IISER Pune in India.<br><br>
    Research in mathematics entails that you spend a lot of time being stuck. Taking your mind off the problem and going back with
    a fresh perspective can be very useful. Here are a bunch of things I do when I am "stuck".<br><br>
    &bull;  Reading is my first hobby, which isn't too surprising considering both my parents are language teachers.<br><br>
    &bull;  I love playing Soccer and this sport has given me countless exhilirating (and heartbreaking) moments in life.<br><br>
    &bull;  I am a foodie, and I enjoy cooking.<br><br>
    &bull;  Very recently, I have developed an interest in photography and am learning more and more each day! <br><br>
    &bull;  Writing is something that I flirt with now and then. You can read some of my stuff on 
    <a href="https://medium.com/@rthwkvidyarthi" target="_blank">Medium</a>.<br><br>
    &bull;  I play the guitar. Improvisation is definitely the most creative outlet for me. Hit me up if you want to jam.
